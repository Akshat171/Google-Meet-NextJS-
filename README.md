## About
This project is a Real-time communication application for people called Hangout. I had fun building this out. This exciting project allowed me to dive deep into the world of web sockets and gain first-hand experience on how synchronized, instantaneous communication is made possible on the web.

I thoroughly enjoyed the process of architecting the real-time flow of data between server and multiple clients. Debugging those rapid state changes as users connected and disconnected was highly stimulating.
